Assignment Deliverables:

Apply knowledge based on learning(s) from Assignment 4 Part 1 and Assignment 4 Part 2,
Perform what you believe would be necessary descriptive statistics that would be required to understand:
the dataset ‘SPARKS’ from NYDOH used in Class 3, but the 2016 version. 

The 2016 data set can be found here (link; https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/gnzp-ekau). 

This descriptive analysis should be detailed enough so:
A physician or nursecould understand what information is contained in the dataset;
What potentially questions might be asked and answered. 


**Recommended try and create at least one descriptive table using the tableone package.
